## Finding Your Strengths

Ready to learn from your content? Let’s go!

In our last edition, we encouraged you to have some fun experimenting with new formats and approaches. Now that you’ve tried out a bunch of things it’s time to see what worked–and didn’t–so you can find your strengths and lean into them with your future content. 

So, how do you measure your wins? Remember to keep your goal in mind. While it's not a numbers game, analytics can help you understand what content is resonating and sparking conversations with your audience. Do you care more about overall engagement? Or are you more interested in specific metrics like reactions or comments? Don’t worry if you’re not totally sure–check out how creator [Brittney Castro](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brittneycastro/) measures her content to better understand what will work for you. 

In this month’s round up, we have featured posts that share member insights on trial and error, a variety of great content from our own audience, and a new feature that can help you make the most out of your Live events. We hope these resources will give you more insight on how to find your own strengths.

As you continue to test and learn, don’t be afraid to ask questions or share feedback–we’re here to help. Let us know how we can support you in future editions by commenting below! 👇

### Featured Posts

_Here are some stand-out posts to draw inspiration from when it comes to finding your strengths. _

**Why this post works**

💡 [Charles](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/charles-miller-wtr_you-have-two-options-when-writing-online-activity-7056969443620311040-U-UW?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)’ first sentence makes it very clear what this post will be about, but he also keeps it broad enough to be relevant to anyone of any industry who is posting online.

💡 In both options, he lists examples of the types of posts he’s talking about, making this valuable to people who may not be well-versed in the variety of content formats there are to choose from.

💡 He then walks you through the decision making process of whether your content fits the bill. If it doesn’t, he tells you what is most likely to happen: being ignored. 

**How Charles leans into his strengths:**

💪 In a broader sense, it’s clear from this post that Charles has learned a lot about what does and doesn’t work when it comes to posting online–and part of how he makes such compelling content is by sharing what he’s learned from his own experience.

**Why this post works:**

💡 [Erin](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/erinlewber_sundayvibes-linkedin-sales-activity-7055987032627548160-txKy?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) pulls the reader in with a hook… “Shhh” so they continue reading.

💡 She shares a personal story that ties back to her goal of letting her audience know why LinkedIn is where she shows up.

💡 She shares a photo that drives home her point that, for her, LinkedIn is all about making real-life friends.

**How Erin leans into her strengths:**

💪 Part of finding your strengths is getting clear on how you define success. For Erin, it’s about building real-life connections. This post demonstrates that she’s clearly doing something right.

💪 More than just being an uplifting post, this type of content demonstrates to others that “success” on LinkedIn doesn’t have to look one way. There are many ways to gauge the success of your content strategy that you can apply to your everyday life.

**Why this post works**

💡 [Jess](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jesscook-contentmarketing_my-biggest-rookie-mistake-was-%3F%3F%3F%3F%3F%3F-activity-7056609042281979904-ugnq?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) starts off with a succinct opening line that tells you what this post will be about: an embarrassing moment in the beginning of her career that she’s since learned from.

💡 Instead of writing a block of text to tell the story, she breaks it down into a list of the most important need-to-know details. This makes it easier to hold her readers’ attention.

💡 She uses fun emojis that capture how she feels without making it unnecessarily long.

💡 She makes it interactive by including two different calls to action: One that inspires her readers to want to share their own experiences, and a second that initiates a more specific discussion.

**How Jess leans into her strengths: **

💪 In this case, it’s quite the opposite in terms of sharing what didn’t go so well when Jess tried something new. She also encourages her community to chime in. She’s vulnerable and that encourages responses like [this](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7056609042281979904?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28activity%3A7056609042281979904%2C7056641389043875840%29&replyUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28activity%3A7056609042281979904%2C7056703953207504896%29) and [this](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7056609042281979904?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28activity%3A7056609042281979904%2C7056611554217082880%29).

### Community Highlight

_As always, we’re listening to your feedback and have learned that content challenges are a great way to spark ideas on what to post and learn from others in your community. In case you missed it, check out how these creators stepped up to our latest content challenge and use their posts as inspiration for your own response! _

Last month we launched the **#OneThingToKnow** content challenge where we challenged you all to create a 10-second video responding to the question: “What is one thing everyone gets wrong about your industry?” We got an overwhelming amount of participation with amazing responses, so we wanted to spotlight a few standouts.

[Pushkraj Deshpande](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/pushkraj-deshpande-435ab7165_onethingtoknow-activity-7057065604335177728-CLcY?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) shared what everyone gets wrong about content creators. Hint: It’s way more than just lights, camera, and a microphone.

[Cassandra Govan](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/cassandragovan_onethingtoknow-activity-7057848931505881088-4sMA?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) says that what most people get wrong about the mental health industry is that behavior and personality are not the same thing.

[Binati Sheth](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/binatisheth_onethingtoknow-ghostwriting-thewritingcatalogue-activity-7057341081872478208-dnfA?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) says the biggest misconception about ghostwriting is that it’s not a collaborative effort. And no, it doesn’t involve writing about ghosts. 😂

It’s not too late to join the challenge–here’s what to do! First, create a quick 10-second video responding to the question above. Second, be sure to add the tag **#OneThingToKnow** and the [LinkedIn for Creators](https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/linkedinforcreators/) handle to your post copy. Lastly, post the video to your feed and drop the link to your post in the comments of our [content challenge](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7057006978060943362) so that the community can see and interact with your video.
