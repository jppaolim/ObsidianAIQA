🚀 OpenAI's ChatGPT is taking the world by storm with over 100 million users in just two months! But what makes their business model so unique? Let's break it down:

🤖 Acting as an aggregator, API, and platform all at once, OpenAI has created a product that can be plugged into other products to make them even better. Developers building on the Intelligence API rely on OpenAI for their core functionality, giving them more reach and power but also making developers reliant on them for their products' success.

💡 With plugins directly integrated into ChatGPT, including browsing, code interpreter, retrieval and third-party plugins - this AI-powered chatbot could allow users to search for products and services across multiple platforms without having to specify plugins or intermediaries. This would put pressure on margins and increase competition among suppliers while incentivizing them to document every attribute that matters.

🌟 The potential of becoming an "apex aggregator" that aggregates other aggregators means OpenAI could capture massive amounts of attention from businesses looking to plug into its recommendations if they want access to its firehose of demand. And with a mission "to create and promote friendly AI for the betterment of humanity," we can expect user experience will always come first.

🔮 So what does the future hold? Will Google or Microsoft adapt fast enough before ChatGPT becomes the default Action Engine? Only time will tell. But one thing is certain: OpenAI's innovative approach is changing how we think about AI technology forever!

🔌 OpenAI's ChatGPT: The Apex Aggregator Reshaping Industries 🌐

OpenAI's unique business model makes it an aggregator, API, and platform all in one. With ChatGPT attracting 100 million users in just 2 months, OpenAI has the potential to become an "apex aggregator" according to a Not Boring report. 🚀

ChatGPT's core functionality allows developers to build products around the Intelligence API, making them reliant on OpenAI for success. By introducing plugins, ChatGPT is transforming into a one-stop-shop for search, discovery, travel planning, and more. 🌎

As an apex aggregator, ChatGPT could pressure businesses to adapt and plug into its platform for access to its massive user base. The AI-powered chatbot would increase competition among suppliers and shift focus from brand differentiation to actual differentiation. 💡

OpenAI's mission is to create friendly AI for humanity's benefit, which means it will prioritize user experience over plugin suppliers. The potential for transaction fees, disintermediation, and regulatory challenges are among the unanswered questions surrounding this powerful business model. 💼

Google, Apple, Meta, and Microsoft currently have larger user bases, but if ChatGPT becomes the default "Action Engine" and builds an ecosystem of plugins quickly, it stands a chance at becoming the world's most profitable company. 🏆
