- Daniel EK : the algotorial
- The way you spend your day is the way you spend your life
- The greatest endemic risk to the psyche in 2021 is not that you’ll end up on the streets next week or fail to fund your retirement in 30 years. The greatest risk is that you’ll feel so relentlessly battered by the weirdness all around that you’ll go numb and simply disengage from the world entirely today.
- everybody is fighting a battle you know nothing about, so be kind - always.

    - Quand on a envie de se gratter c’est agréable de se gratter
    - Mais c’est encore plus agréable de ne plus avoir envie de se gratter
- We each teach that thing that we need most
