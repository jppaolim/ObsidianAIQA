> Leaving your money to die in the bank is the worst thing you can do. Invest it.
Don’t try to beat the market with clever investments. Just diversify with index funds or ETFs. At least with most of your money. If you want to invest yourself, only do that with money you’re ok losing. It’s play money. Don’t gamble your retirement away.
Be very careful with fees and commissions. Ideally, the combination of both should be about 0.5% or less. Don’t ever pay weird costs like upfront commissions.
Optimize your taxes as much as you can.
Assume you’ll retire later than 65. 70 is a good age to aim for. 75 is even better. The best is if you find a career that isn’t work at all, and you look forward to keep working instead of dreading every day until then.
